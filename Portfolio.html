        <h1>Projects Completed</h1>
        <p>During my time at Grand Circus, I have completed several projects that I am particularly proud of. I will continue 
            to add projects that I complete throughout the class.</p>
        <h2>Project 1: <a href="https://github.com/marilara/Rock-Paper-Scissors" target="_blank">RPS Console App</a></h2>
        <p>Descrition: This program allows the user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors with one of two players. It keeps 
            count of the number of times the user wins and losses.</p>
        <h2>Project 2: <a href="https://github.com/marilara/SugarRayFanClub" target="_blank">Sugar Ray Fan Club Merchandise Store</a></h2>
        <p>Descrition: This program was a team effort and was created to sell Sugar Ray Merchandise. It required team 
            collaboration using GitHub and through team stand-up meetings. We created a store with inventory and that tracks items bought in previous purchases. 
            Additionally, we allowed for different types of payment options.</p>
